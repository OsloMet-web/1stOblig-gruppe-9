    <h1>Negative side with group work</h1>
   <p> When forming a group, it is natural for some group members to be more extroverted than others. This could be a good quality, but also a challenge. The one talking the loudest isnâ€™t always the one with the greatest ideas. When doing a project in a group, it is necessary for all members to be able to share their ideas and be heard. It can be hard to find the right balance.</p>
   <h2>Positive side with group work</h2>
   <p> When working together in a group versus working individually the group gets the benefit of distributing roles within the group. When doing this the members could complete each other by assigning tasks that suit the members. The group labor would be more effective and hopefully the quality too.</p>
