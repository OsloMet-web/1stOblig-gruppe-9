<p> My VGS was quite large, and very nicely located on the outskirts of town, away from the noise of cars and other traffic.
The school had many halls for practicing different types of sports. </p>

<p> My VGS was actually small but had the best view specially in summer time.
    It was near the ocean and we had sometimes apportunity to swim after school. But above all it had the best school inviroment. </p>

<p>My VGS was very nice and centrally located in Oslo, actually just a few steps from OsloMet. The school itself was physically big, as it consisted of three buildings - almost like Oslomet.
   It is a well known in society that the school is one of the best VGSÂ´s in Norway as it prepares its student extremely well for higher-education. </p>
