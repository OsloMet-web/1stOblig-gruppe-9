    <h1>The Interplay between Technology and Society</h1>
   <p>Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea and
underground cables. Despite the global nature of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical cables
makes its flow of information sometimes subject to national borders. One recent example of this is the new
Norwegian E-Law (2020), which propose that the intelligence service can monitor and collect all data that
goes across the national border</p>
