    <h1>Technology & Society for Programmers</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine that three years from now, you have finished your degree at
      OsloMet and have just been recruited to one of the largest consultancy
      firms in Norway. In the first week in your new position, you are told by
      your supervisor that, in addition to your individual tasks, you will be
      working with a small team of 5-6 people, who regularly meet to discuss and
      find good balanced solutions to complex situations and problems within the
      company or society in general.
    </p>
    <h2>Benefits of working in small groups</h2>
    <p>
      Group work is advantageous as it enhances creativity. This is because
      multiple perspectives contribute to different creative solutions.
      Moreover, the act of discussing itself is a creative process that sets
      itself apart from independent thinking. Solutions reached collectively in
      groups tend to be more robust, as they have already undergone a critical
      process in their development. When working individually, one may be biased
      in the creation of their own solution. Allocation of responsibilities
      helps in creating solutions more efficiently and enables responsibility to
      be assigned to individuals who excel in solving specific problems within
      their area of expertise."
    </p>
    <h3>The importance of disagreeing when solving complex cases</h3>
    <p>
      Disagreement is advantageous in complex matters as it involves a critical
      process while performing the task itself. This leads to any issues with
      the solution to the complex problem being identified earlier in the
      process. It is also beneficial because of the diversity of perspectives
      and skills, which contributes to arriving at the best possible conclusion.
      By distributing the complex work among different members with varying
      expertise, a solution can be reached more quickly.
    </p>
    <h4>Solutions to "missing" colleagues</h4>
    <p>
      If one of the members no longer contributes or communicates with the other
      members, it would be advantageous to take several steps:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first would be to try as much as possible to get in touch with the individual and find out why they are no longer participating.</li>
            <li>Attempt to find a solution. If it proves impossible to contact the individual or reach a resolution, it will be necessary to consult with higher-level management at the workplace on how to further address this.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
