<h1>Instructions:</h1>
<p> Below you will find the assignment for this module, or lecture. 
You answer the assignment by filling in the form.
The form includes 7 steps that will guide your discussions.  Each step includes a short description of 
what you should do. It also includes a suggested timeframe for each step. You fill in the form by way of keywords or full paragraphs.
Use sources, when necessary, there is a section at the end for references. Preferably use the style of APA7th.
Each step is given an approximate word count, meant as a guideline, rather than absolute criteria. 
</p>
<h2>Before you start solving the assignment, you need to distribute roles in the group:</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> There needs to be a group leader, for this assignment, who is responsible for reading out the assignment and following the 7 steps.</li>
<li>A note-taker, which does the writing, saves the document and hands it in, in Canvas, when you have finished the assignment.</li>
<li>A timekeeper, which assures that you stay within the allocated time frame.</li>
<li>All other members of the group must be stated under “other members” by their full name.</li>
<li>Only members of the group that have their name on this assignment, and hence have actually participated in the discussion,
    can get a pass and include the assignment as 1 of 5 obligatory assignments qualifying for the exam.</li>
</ul> </p>
<br> </br>
<p> The point of filling in a table, rather than writing a longer essay, is that answers should be brief and concise.
    Before the discussions you should have prepared individually by going through the corresponding material in Canvas.
    All assignments should include reference to material in Canvas. This does not have to include a proper academic source in APA7th,
    it is ok to say for example “as Geirbo says under page 1.3 in Canvas….”
